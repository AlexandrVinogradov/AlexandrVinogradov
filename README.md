### @About me {

At my last job in outsourcing company "NoLogoStudio" I was a lead frontend-developer on projects. Worked on various projects from a service for the sale of telecommunication cables to a platform for streaming surgical operations.
Also I interviewed candidates for the position of frontend-developer.

Mostly worked with the stack: React/Redux, scss, webpack, pug, native js

Also I programmed UI and business logic, worked with rest-API, worked on complex animation, did cross-browser, adaptive layout.

https://newhorizons.top/ - business card site with animation
http://sova-dance.ru/ - a project completely developed by me on freelance 2019

I can also show a lot of my work locally so as not to violate the NDA

Looking for a position as a react.js developer position in a company that will become the second home. Where I will be able to grow quickly and develop skills in web development every day.
