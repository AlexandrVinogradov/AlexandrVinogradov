### @About me {

At my current place of work "Sberbank" I hold the position of Lead-Frontend developer.
I Developed the Network Access System to replace Cisco ISE. The project included complex interfaces with numerous tables, forms, charts, and drag-and-drop functionality. The application ranked among the top 10 in security within the bank's internal systems.

Started the project from scratch when I joined the team as the sole Frontend developer. Throughout the process, I built a team of four, including developers of varying levels, to enhance development speed and maintain quality.

Developed the entire design from the ground up with the Frontend team, creating a custom UI Kit for component unification and accelerated development.

Successfully completed the MVP stage, building a scalable and reliable system that meets the bank's requirements.

Stack: React, TypeScript, GraphQL (Apollo), Redux Toolkit, and Twin.macro.

Responsible for all key architectural decisions, feature planning, recruitment and onboarding of team members, conducting code reviews, and ensuring code quality.

<br>

I also developed a completely finished Full-Stack SOE Project - online store for safes for my family.
